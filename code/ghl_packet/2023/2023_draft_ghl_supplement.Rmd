# Background
This document summarizes weathervane scallop *Patinopecten caurinus* fishery dependent and fishery independent data to aid in setting guideline harvest levels (GHLs) for the 2022/23 season, scheduled to begin July 1. Amendment 3 to the Fishery Management Plan for the Scallop Fishery off Alaska (FMP) delegated authority to manage all aspects of the federal waters scallop fishery except limited access to the State of Alaska. ADF\&G sets GHLs prior to each season, opens and closes scallop fishing areas and districts, oversees the onboard observer program, monitors scallop fishery catch and bycatch inseason, summarizes scallop management activities in department publications, and participates in the federal management process through the North Pacific Fishery Management Council (NPFMC) and Scallop Plan Team (SPT) (NPFMC 2014).

# OFL and ABC
Amendment 13 of the weathervane scallop FMP to incorporate Annual Catch Limits (ACLs) required by the 2006 reauthorization of the Magnuson-Stevens Act redefined the statewide overfishing level (OFL) from 1.24 million lb to 1.284 million lb of shucked scallop meats (NPFMC 2014). The change was made to account for all sources of fishing mortality including harvest, discarded scallop catch in the directed fishery, bycatch in other fisheries, and survey catches. The annual ACL / Annual Biological Catch (ABC) will equal 90\% of OFL, or 1.156 million lb of shucked meats, subject to annual approval by the NPFMC. For the ACL amendment analysis leading to the new OFL definition, mortality of scallops discarded in the fishery was assumed to be 20\%, and meat recovery was set at 10\% of scallop round weight (NPFMC 2014).  

The Scallop Plan Team met on March 6, 2023 and recommended proxies for OFL and ABC as defined in the FMP (OFL = 1.284 million lb; ABC = 1.156 million lb). The SSC and NPFMC adopted these recommendations at the April 2023 meeting. 

# Data sources and updates
## Fishery Data
Fishery data presented in this document include logbook information completed by vessel captains and data collection by observers during sampled dredges. All fishery data can be accessed on the Kodiak Wiki via the following link **\url{http://kodweb.fishgame.state.ak.us/index/Data_Access:Scallop_Observer:}**. Although scallop vessel operators sign waivers that allow ADF\&G to publish data collected by the onboard observer program, material included in this report such as individual vessel fishing locations, catches, and catch rates are **\textit{Confidential}** and should not be released to the public.

## Survey Data
Available recent survey data include the Statewide Weathervane Scallop Dredge survey (henceforth dredge survey) (Smith et al., 2016; Burt et al. 2021), the Westward Region Large-Mesh Bottom Trawl Survey (henceforth trawl survey) (Spalinger 2015), and the NMFS RACE EBS Bottom Trawl Survey (referred to as trawl survey for area Q only). For dredge survey data access, contact Ryan Burt (ryan.burt@alaska.gov). Trawl survey data can be accessed on the Kodiak Wiki via the following link \url{http://kodweb.fishgame.state.ak.us/index/Data_Access:Trawl_Survey:Large_Mesh:}. EBS trawl survey data are available via AKFIN. Dredge survey results are presented elsewhere and can be found in the most recently published survey report (Williams et al. 2017; Jackson et al. 2021) or annual NPFMC SAFE reports (NPFMC 2017-2022).  

Trawl survey tows were assigned to scallop management districts using spatial polygons constructed from district boundary lines and shorelines. It is important to note that fisheries independent data presented here do not represent direct estimates of abundance or biomass, rather indices that inform relative trends in those metrics. Further, trawl survey methods and gear configuration are not deisgned for sampling scallops and catchability of scallops ($q$) is unknown, though it's likely less than $q$ = 1. While trawl survey data are presented here in comparision with fishery data, interpretation of these data should be done so conservatively.

Beds are the most basic population unit, and appear to undergo different dynamics even within the same district. As a result, bed specific data summaries are important to understanding interannual trends in fishing performance and biological characteristics of the fished stock. Bed designations are preliminary and will be refined as appropriate bed boudaries are determined, and decision points are made regarding "unknown" locations. In the KSW district, bed was assigned for CPUE standardization (see below) as being north or south of 57.1$^{\circ}$ latitude.

Recent changes in management boundaries include the reclassification of the Karluk scallop beds to the Kodiak Southwest district (from Kodiak Shelikof), and merging of Yakutat Districts (previously D16 and D). Logbook data presented here that included both bed and location information here have been revised to reflect current management boundaries. This includes effort and retained catch analyses. 

Catch per unit effort (CPUE) estimates presented in this document include nominal (i.e., raw) meat weight CPUE, round weight CPUE, and standardized round weight CPUE. **All CPUE estimates presented here are nominal values unless stated otherwise**.

## Data Updates
* Data on clappers includes both vessel, not just the $F/V$ $Provider$ so as to include data west of the Kodiak Registration Area.

# Analyses
## Spatial extent of catch
The spatial scale of the fishery effort and catch provides necessary insight to interpreting trends in fishing performance. For instance, good fishing performance corresponding to intense effort in a small area does not necessarily indicate good health of the stock as a whole, or vice-versa. Here, spatial extent of the fishery catch was computed as the average pairwise distance among dredge start locations. Using this approach, both the range and density of fishing effort are considered in characterizing spatial extent. Units are decimal degrees of latitude and longitude, thus the value of spatial extent is not directly interpretable, rather it serves as a relative index over the fishery timeseries. Only hauls contritubing the top 90\% of a season's catch where included in this analysis, so not to include "exploratory" fishing effort that was not fruitful.

## CPUE standardization
Interpretation of CPUE estimates as an index of abundance is reliant upon a fundamental relationship in fisheries analysis

\begin{equation}
U_{t}=C_{t}/E_{t}=qN_{t}
\end{equation}

where $C_t$ is catch at time $t$, $E_t$ is the effort expended at time $t$, $N_t$ is abundance at time $t$, and $q$ is the portion of the stock captured by one unit of effort (catchability coefficient). Provided $q$ is constant over time, CPUE is proportional to abundance, though it is rare that $q$ is constant over the entire exploitation history. 

Fishery statistics presented in this report are affected by many factors. In particular, these data are influenced by the spatial structure of the Alaska scallop population and non-random allocation of fishing effort. Scallop CPUE is affected by each vessel's choice of fishing location as well as weather, currents, sea state, captain and crew performance, gear tuning, processing capacity, markets, etc. Scallop shell height distributions from observer sampling are likewise affected by fishing locations and discarding as well as by the 4" diameter rings required by Alaska regulations that retain small scallops with lower efficiency than large scallops. 

Standardizing CPUE (controlling for variables that affect catch aside from population abundance) is a difficult process, which may be subject to improvements over time. Standardized CPUE estimates presented in this document represent the most current standardization method, which uses a generalized additive model (GAM) in the form of 

\begin{equation}
(U + \gamma) = f_1(depth~\cdot~Bed) + f_2(longitude\cdot~Bed) + Month + Vessel + Bed + Season + \epsilon
\end{equation}

where $f_i$ are smoothing functions, and month, vessel, bed, and season are parametric effects. All standardization models were fit with a gamma response distribution and log-link. Reference values for parametric effects (i.e., factors) were the mode of each variable scross the full timeseries. A small modifier ($\gamma$) was added to CPUE estimates to avoid zero values. Standardized CPUE in season $i$ was computed as the marginal of season $i$ ($\beta_{j,i}$), back-transformed using

\begin{equation}
\hat{U_{i}} = e^{\beta_{j,i} + \frac{\sigma_{j,i}}{2}} - \gamma
\end{equation}

where ($\beta_{j,i}$) and $\sigma_{j,i}$ are the point estimate and standard error of the $j^{th}$ parametric effect (i.e., season) in year $i$.

## Discard estimation
Round weight and count of scallop discards, and number of clappers, is recorded by observers during every sampled dredge. Total discarded scallops ($\hat{D}$) is estimated as

\begin{equation}
\hat{D} = \frac{\sum_{i = 1}^{n} d_{i}}{\sum_{i = 1}^{n} s_{i}} \times \sum_{i = 1}^{n} h_{i}
\end{equation}

where $d_{i}$ is the number, or round weight, of discards (or clappers), $s_{i}$ is total observer sample hours, and $h_{i}$ is total dredge hours in day $i$ of the fishery. Discarded scallop count data is only available for intact scallop and not broken scallops. Therefore, **counts of scallop discards presented in this document should be interpreted as intact scallops only, whereas round weight of scallop discards includes both intact and broken scallops.** The ratio of intact to broken scallops in total discard weight is presented separately. Discard mortality is estimated to be 20% of total round weight or count of intact scallops, though additional research should be conducted to inform this analysis.

Retention curves were estimated as a logistic function of shell height. Sizes at 10% (R$_{10}$) and 50% (R$_{50}$) retention were estimate to represent the smallest size are retained by the fishery, and the size at which half of scallop are retained by the fishery.

## Bycatch estimation
Bycatch of Tanner crab ($Chionoecetes$ $bairdi$), snow crab ($Chionoecetes$ $opilio$), and red king crab ($Paralithodes$  $camtschaticus$) is closely tracked in-season relative to a predetermined crab bycatch limit (CBL). All registration areas except for Yakutat utilize CBLs for at least one of these species. Other non-target species of interest include Dungeness crab ($Metacarcinus$ $magister$) and Pacific halibut ($Hippoglossus$ $stenolepis$), though no bycatch limits exist for those species. Total bycatch ($\hat{C}$) of each species for a season is estimated as 

\begin{equation}
\hat{C} = \frac{\sum_{i = 1}^{n} c_{i}}{\sum_{i = 1}^{n} s_{i}} \times \sum_{i = 1}^{n} h_{i}
\end{equation}

where $c_{i}$ is the catch (count) of a species, $s_{i}$ is total observer sample hours, and $h_{i}$ is total dredge hours in day $i$ of the fishery. Total bycatch of red king crab is reported in fishery logbooks, thus no expansion calculation is necessary. In bycatch analyses presented by day, days without observer sampling are assigned the average bycatch rate for the season, in that district.

## Fishery biological information
Shell height is measured for 40 retained and 40 discarded scallops during every observer sampled tow. Shell height distribution observed over the entire season is estimated by weighting the shell height composition of a given tow by the round weight catch of retained and discarded scallops of that tow, relative to all tows in the season.

Since the 2016/17 season, observers have collected individual meats from a subset of measured scallops per tow. The relationship between shell height and meat weight is allometric in the form of 

\begin{equation}
W = \alpha L^{\beta}
\end{equation}

where $W$ is meat weight (g), $L$ is shell height (mm), while $\alpha$ and $\beta$ are shape and scale parameters of the allometric function, respectively. The meat weight \~ shell height relationship and the effect of season were evaluated among registration areas in Jackson et al. (2021). Here, data are just plotted for each district, grouped by season.

# Kodiak Registration Area (K)  
The Kodiak registration area (K) contains five districts: Northeast (KNE), Shelikof (KSH), Southwest (KSW), Southeat (KSE), and Semidi Islands (KSEM). All districts were fished within GHLs during the 2021/22 season except for KSEM and KSE. Accordingly, no fishery information regarding KSEM and KSE are presented in district specific analyses here. The most recent dredge surveys in area K were conducted in 2016 (KSH), 2017 (KSH, KNE), 2018 (KSH), 2020, and 2022 (KSH, KNE). The trawl survey is conducted within area K on an annual basis.

# Alaska Penninsula Registration Area (M)
The Alaska Penninsula registration area (M) contains three districts: Unimak Bight (UB), Central (C), and West Chignik (WC). Fishery statistics within area M are presented here with all districts combined, unless otherwise noted. Area M has never been included in the dredge survey, though several trawl survey stations within area M are sampled on an annual basis.

# Dutch Harbor Registration Area (O)
The Dutch Harbor registration area (O) consists of a single district, but is managed on the basis of beds, one on the Bering Sea side and one on the Pacific Ocean side of Unalaska Island. During the 2020/21 season, the Pacific Ocean side was closed and the Bering Sea side was fished within a monitoring GHL of 5,000 lbs. Area O has never been included in the dredge survey, though several trawl survey stations within area O are sampled on an annual basis.

# Bering Sea Registration Area (Q)
The Bering Sea registration area (Q) consists of a single district, with fishing effort predominately occuring north of Unimak Island. Area Q used to contribute a substantial proportion of the statewide harvest until the 2014/15 season, when scallop meat quality began suffering from weak meats. Since then, minimal GHL's have been used to maintain availability of fishery data.

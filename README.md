A respository for the assessment of weathervane scallops. Contains analyses related to fishery data, survey data, and development of a model based assessment.


## Structure  
The structure of the repository is a work in progress, but generally follows: 
* code - includes scripts to perform analyses, organized in subdirectories related to specific tasks
* data - includes all relevant data. No data is shared on GitHub. Contact Tyler Jackson, tyler.jackson@alask.gov, for access  
* output - includes output of analyses, organized in subdirectories related to specific tasks
* figures - includes printed figures, organized in subdirectories related to specific tasks

## Disclaimer
Recent consolidation of this directory from three previous directories (scallop_observer, scallop_assessment, and statewide_scallop_survey) has resulted in breaking many directory links within scripts. These errors will be corrected as they are encountered (by Tyler Jackson)
